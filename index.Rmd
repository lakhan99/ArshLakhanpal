## About myself 

I am a third year students who is majoring Actuarial Science and Statistics while minoring in Mathematics at the University of Toronto. I find the idea of working with data and producing graphs and tables to tell a story about the data extremely fascinating and rewarding. 

Frank Hermosillo studies neural networks and their applications at Google 
Brain. His research focuses on differentiable network pruning approximation and 
decentralized gradient inversion mechanics. He frequently collaborates with 
researchers who study machine learning, computer vision, and cognitive science.
His work has been featured in WIRED, The Atlantic, Newsweek, and The New York 
Times Magazine.
