## About myself 

I am a third year students who is majoring Actuarial Science and Statistics while minoring in Mathematics at the University of Toronto. I am from India and came to Canada in 2006 and attended all levels of schooling in Toronto.

The reason I decided to study Statistics is because I enjoy working with data. I find the idea of taking raw data and producing graphs and tables to tell a story about it extremely fascinating and rewarding. My younger self would always work with numbers and because of that I decided that I would study Actuarial Science as well.  

In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, specifically learning finger style variations of some of my favorite songs!
